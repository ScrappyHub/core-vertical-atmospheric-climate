# CORE VERTICAL — Atmospheric & Climate Systems

This repository defines the Atmospheric vertical for CORE.

It is a **physics-driven atmospheric interaction platform**
focused on coupling, stress, and energy transfer.

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

- ATMOS — atmospheric state & coupling
- THERMOS — heat transfer
- MAGNETAR — EM–air interaction
- ARES — pressure & wave propagation
- SIGNAL — coherence & anomaly detection
- RGSR — fusion

## Real-World Phenomena Modeled

- Hurricanes & cyclones
- Shockwaves
- Atmospheric resonance
- EM interference in air
- Thermal pressure gradients

## What This Vertical Is

- A **physics interpretation system**
- A **storm dynamics analysis tool**
- A **climate coupling research environment**

## What This Vertical Is Not

- Not a weather app
- Not a forecast authority
- Not a policy engine

## Registries & Lenses

- Atmospheric profiles
- Humidity/pressure presets
- Storm archetype libraries

## Governance
